                The Other Miss Bridgerton
            </h3>
            <h3 class="Author">
                By Julia Quinn
            </h3>
            <p class="detail">
            <h3>Review:</h3> Julia Quinn continues her Bridgertons prequel series with a seafaring romp of the highest
            order. Quinn is a
            master of historical romance (just ask Shonda Rhimes), as The Other Miss Bridgerton demonstrates 18 years
            after The Duke
            and I first hit shelves. So many of us read romance to escape, whether to quiet our mind after the ordeal of
            a car
            accident (raises hand!) or to give us a burst of happiness at the end of the day. Whatever you need escaping
            from, The
            Other Miss Bridgerton should do the trick. The incorrigibly curious Poppy Bridgerton is exploring a
            smuggler’s cave on
            the Dorset coast when she runs across pirates who kidnap her and bring her aboard their ship. Captain Andrew
            James
            Rokesby, who is no mere pirate, but a transporter of government secrets, cannot lose any time on his
            mission, which
            leaves him no choice but to bring Poppy along for the journey. Their irritation with their circumstances
            quickly melts
            to begrudging attraction and eventually, the undeniable spark of love. Quinn's effortless banter is sure to
            leave a
            smile on your face with each increasingly flirtatious exchange. Her characters are irresistible for their
            wit,
            intelligence, and bookish obsessions (in this case, geography, architecture, and Shakespeare). The
            kidnapping plot might
            ruffle some feathers, but Quinn does an expert job making it a case of utmost necessity, ensuring Andrew is
            the
            consummate gentleman merely caught up in the requirements of his job. Though the book is light on bedroom
            scenes, Quinn
            makes even the most chaste passages smolder, the chemistry and romantic tension crackling off the page with
            something as
            simple as assembling a puzzle. Poppy is a headstrong, adventurous delight; her joy at seeing things like the
            stars in
            the night sky and the streets of a foreign country are truly infectious. It's easy to see why Andrew can’t
            help but be
            wooed by her natural curiosity and genuine interest in the things he prizes most. Andrew himself is a
            kindhearted man, a
            captain who treats his crew with the utmost decency and care, and a swoony hero with the mussed hair and
            deep tenderness
            romance readers crave. With The Other Miss Bridgerton, Quinn has delivered another read as delightful as the
            malasadas
            her characters share here — a warm, sugary, melt-in-your-mouth confection.
